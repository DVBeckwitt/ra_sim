# Material and constant definitions used by the diffraction calculations.
#
# The "constants" block defines values that are shared between all materials.
# The "materials" block contains individual material entries.  Each material
# defines its bulk density (g/cm^3), the elemental composition in units of the
# chemical formula, and the elemental properties required for the index of
# refraction calculation.  Additional materials can be added by following the
# same structure and updating "default_material".
